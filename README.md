# Cirrhosis-Importance-Feature
This project focuses on estimating the stage of liver cirrhosis using machine learning models from exploratory data analysis to modeling, evaluation, and feature-importance interpretation.

Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease, and early detection of severity is crucial for treatment decisions. In this project, we analyze a clinical dataset containing laboratory values, demographic attributes, and disease indicators to:
- Clean and preprocess medical data
- Explore patterns and anomalies
- Train multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate performance using classification metrics
- Identify the most influential features affecting cirrhosis staging

The notebook implements and compares several models from scikit-learn, including:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost (if included)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV
